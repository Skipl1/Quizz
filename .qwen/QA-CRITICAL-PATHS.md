## 1. Player Join Flow

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | Player opens `http://localhost:3000` | ✅ PASS | `express.static("public")` serves index.html correctly |
| 1.2 | Enters name → clicks "Войти в игру" | ✅ PASS | `register()` function reads input, emits `register` event |
| 1.3 | `register` event emitted → `registered` event received | ✅ PASS | Server handles `register` (line 602), emits `registered` (lines 614, 628, 668, 704) |
| 1.4 | Session stored in sessionStorage | ✅ PASS | `STORAGE_KEY = "quiz_player_session"`, stored on `registered` callback |
| 1.5 | Waiting screen shown until admin starts quiz | ✅ PASS | `showScreen("waiting-screen")` after registration |
| 1.6 | Session restoration on reconnect | ✅ PASS | `checkSavedSession()` reads sessionStorage, emits `register` with `savedId` |
| 1.7 | Reconnection of existing player (same name, not answered) | ✅ PASS | Server finds existing player by name and rebinds socket ID |
| 1.8 | `quiz-already-started` blocks late joiners | ✅ PASS | Server emits `quiz-already-started` if `quizStarted === true` |

### Issues Found

- **⚠️ ISSUE 1.3a — Missing error callback on `register` emit:** In `index.html` line 1005, `socket.emit("register", name)` is called without a callback. If the server-side handler throws (e.g., DB error during `initPlayerQuestions`), the client never receives an error. The `registered` event is emitted, but there's no fallback if the server crashes mid-handler.
- **⚠️ ISSUE 1.6a — Session restoration doesn't handle stale IDs:** If `savedId` points to a disconnected player (already deleted from `players` object), the fallback creates a **duplicate player** with the same name instead of rejecting. The code checks `players[savedId]` but the reconnection logic for same-name players (line 649) only matches players with `!p.answeredQuestions.length`, which could cause unexpected behavior.
- **⚠️ ISSUE 1.8a — `quiz-already-started` uses `alert()` then `location.reload()`:** This is a harsh UX. A disconnected player who refreshes gets stuck in a reload loop if the quiz is still running.

---

## 2. Answer Flow

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 2.1 | Admin starts quiz → `start-quiz` event | ✅ PASS | Server handler at line 584, sets `quizStarted = true` |
| 2.2 | Player receives `new-question` with question data | ✅ PASS | `sendNextQuestionToPlayer()` emits `new-question` (line 830) |
| 2.3 | Timer starts (30s default) | ✅ PASS | `startTimer(data.timeLeft || QUESTION_TIME)` in client |
| 2.4 | Player submits answer → `submit-answer` event | ✅ PASS | Multiple submit functions emit `submit-answer` with various payloads |
| 2.5 | Score calculated (10 base + time bonus) | ✅ PASS | `player.score += 10 + bonus` at line 759 |
| 2.6 | Next question sent automatically | ✅ PASS | `setTimeout(() => sendNextQuestionToPlayer(...), 500)` at line 770 |
| 2.7 | Time-up handling | ⚠️ PARTIAL | `time-up` event handled, but race condition exists (see below) |
| 2.8 | `player-quiz-ended` when all questions answered | ✅ PASS | Emitted from `sendNextQuestionToPlayer` when queue exhausted |

### Issues Found

- **🔴 ISSUE 2.5a — Race condition: `submit-answer` + `time-up` can both fire:** If a player submits an answer at the exact moment the timer hits 0, both `submit-answer` and `time-up` handlers execute. The server's `submit-answer` handler has a guard (`if (player.answeredQuestions.includes(...))`), but the `time-up` handler on the client (line 1393) also emits `submit-answer` for partial answers. **Both can reach the server before the first one marks the question as answered.** The 500ms `setTimeout` in `submit-answer` doesn't prevent this because the server processes events synchronously.
- **🔴 ISSUE 2.5b — Double-answer vulnerability:** The client-side `hasAnswered` flag prevents double submission in the browser, but there's **no server-side guard** against a malicious client sending multiple `submit-answer` events for the same question. The check `if (player.answeredQuestions.includes(player.currentQuestion.originalIndex))` at line 718 only works *after* the first answer is processed. If two events arrive in the same tick, both pass the check.
- **⚠️ ISSUE 2.5c — Time bonus calculation uses server `QUESTION_TIME` constant (30s), not the question's `timeLimit`:** At line 756, `bonus = Math.max(0, Math.floor((QUESTION_TIME - timeSpent) / 3))` uses the hardcoded `QUESTION_TIME = 30` instead of `question.timeLimit`. If an admin sets a 60-second question, the bonus calculation is wrong (player gets negative bonus capped at 0 for any answer over 30s).
- **⚠️ ISSUE 2.7a — `time-up` handler on server doesn't validate player state:** The `time-up` handler (line 783) pushes `currentQuestion.originalIndex` to `answeredQuestions` without checking if `currentQuestion` is non-null (though there's a guard `if (player.currentQuestion)`). However, if `time-up` arrives after `submit-answer` has already processed but before the 500ms `setTimeout` fires, it could push a duplicate index.
- **⚠️ ISSUE 2.3a — Timer on client uses `setInterval` with 1s tick:** This can drift. For a 30s timer, drift is negligible, but for accuracy-critical scoring, `Date.now()` delta would be better.

---

## 3. Leaderboard Flow

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 3.1 | After each answer, `update-leaderboard` broadcast | ✅ PASS | `broadcastLeaderboard()` called in `submit-answer` handler (line 768) |
| 3.2 | Player sees score updated (hidden during game) | ✅ PASS | Client updates `playerScore` but doesn't display it during gameplay |
| 3.3 | Final leaderboard shown when all questions answered | ✅ PASS | `player-quiz-ended` → `get-final-leaderboard` → `final-leaderboard` |
| 3.4 | `final-leaderboard` event with full ranking | ✅ PASS | Server handler at line 794, emits sorted leaderboard |
| 3.5 | Admin sees live leaderboard in "Рейтинг" tab | ✅ PASS | Admin listens to `update-leaderboard` (line 2166) |
| 3.6 | `all-players-finished` notification to admin | ✅ PASS | `checkAllPlayersFinished()` emits at line 895 |

### Issues Found

- **⚠️ ISSUE 3.1a — `broadcastLeaderboard` uses `io.emit` (broadcasts to ALL clients):** This includes the admin panel, which is correct, but also broadcasts to players who have already finished and are on the end screen. Not a bug, but unnecessary traffic.
- **⚠️ ISSUE 3.3a — `getLeaderboard()` sorts by score only:** Players with equal scores have undefined ordering. Should add a secondary sort key (e.g., `answeredQuestions.length` or name) for deterministic ranking.
- **⚠️ ISSUE 3.6a — `checkAllPlayersFinished` only triggers when a player finishes:** If a player disconnects before finishing, they're removed from `players` object, which could cause `all-players-finished` to fire prematurely. Example: 3 players start, 1 disconnects, remaining 2 finish → `allFinished` becomes true even though the disconnected player never completed.

---

## 4. Admin Control Flow

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 4.1 | Admin login at /admin.html with credentials | ✅ PASS | `admin-login` event, checks against `ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` |
| 4.2 | Create quiz → `create-quiz` event | ✅ PASS | Handler at line 310, supports both DB and RAM modes |
| 4.3 | Add questions (6 types) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | See issues below |
| 4.4 | Select quiz → `select-quiz` event | ✅ PASS | Handler at line 530, initializes player questions |
| 4.5 | Start quiz → `start-quiz` event | ✅ PASS | Handler at line 584 |
| 4.6 | Restart quiz → `restart-quiz` event | ✅ PASS | Handler at line 553 |
| 4.7 | View live leaderboard in "Рейтинг" tab | ✅ PASS | `update-leaderboard` listener at line 2166 |
| 4.8 | Download CSV results | ✅ PASS | `downloadResults()` emits `get-final-leaderboard`, generates CSV |

### Issues Found

- **🔴 ISSUE 4.3a — Missing question type `open_ended` in admin UI:** The admin panel has tabs for `multiple_choice`, `true_false`, `fill_blank`, `ordering`, and `matching` — but **`open_ended` is NOT in the question type selector** (admin.html line 1067-1097). The server and player support it, but admins cannot create `open_ended` questions through the UI.
- **🔴 ISSUE 4.3b — `add-question` handler lacks admin session check for DB path:** At line 361, `socket.on("add-question", ...)` checks `if (!adminSessions[socket.id]) return;` but the DB query at line 383 uses `data.text`, `data.options`, etc. **directly without sanitization** — only the in-memory `questionData` object uses sanitized values. The raw unsanitized data goes into the database.
- **⚠️ ISSUE 4.3c — `update-question` has the same sanitization gap:** Lines 468-480 write raw `data.text`, `data.options` to DB while only the in-memory copy is sanitized.
- **⚠️ ISSUE 4.3d — No validation of `correct` array bounds:** For `multiple_choice`, if `correct` contains an index >= `options.length`, the answer validation in `submit-answer` (line 735) will silently fail (no answer can match an out-of-bounds correct index).
- **⚠️ ISSUE 4.6a — `restart-quiz` resets `quizStarted = false` but doesn't notify players who are mid-question:** Players currently answering a question will submit their answer, get the next question, but the quiz is now "not started." The `quiz-restarted` event is emitted, but players on the question screen don't transition to waiting until they finish their current question or the page reloads.
- **⚠️ ISSUE 4.8a — CSV download triggered from admin's `final-leaderboard` listener:** The admin's `downloadResults()` function emits `get-final-leaderboard`, which triggers `final-leaderboard` event. But this event is also emitted to players who finished. If a player finishes at the same moment admin downloads CSV, both receive the same event. Not a critical bug, but the event serves dual purposes.

## 5. Security & Code Quality Audit

### 5.1 `console.log` Statements

| File | Count | Severity | Recommendation |
|------|-------|----------|----------------|
| `server.js` | 24 | ⚠️ INFO | Acceptable for server-side logging, but should use a proper logger (winston/pino) in production |
| `create-tables.js` | 9 | ✅ OK | Migration script — console output is expected |
| `public/index.html` | 0 | ✅ PASS | No console.log in production client code |
| `public/admin.html` | 0 | ✅ PASS | No console.log in production client code |

**Verdict:** Server-side `console.log` is acceptable for development. Before production merge, replace with structured logging.

### 5.2 Hardcoded Values

| Location | Value | Severity | Recommendation |
|----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| `server.js:82` | `ADMIN_PASSWORD \|\| "admin123"` | 🔴 HIGH | Default password must not be hardcoded. Fail-safe: require `.env` |
| `server.js:81` | `ADMIN_LOGIN \|\| "admin"` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Default login is less critical but still a risk |
| `server.js:67` | `QUESTION_TIME = 30` (module scope) | 🟡 MEDIUM | Used in bonus calculation instead of per-question `timeLimit` (see ISSUE 2.5c) |
| `server.js:27` | `SOCKET_RATE_WINDOW_MS = 10_000` | ✅ OK | Reasonable default |
| `server.js:28` | `SOCKET_RATE_MAX_EVENTS = 30` | ✅ OK | Reasonable default |
| `public/index.html:991` | `QUESTION_TIME = 30` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Duplicated from server; should be received from server |
| `public/admin.html` | `selectedTime = 20` | ✅ OK | Default UI value, overridden by user selection |

### 5.3 Dependency Vulnerabilities

| Dependency | Version | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| `express` | `^4.18.2` | ✅ No known critical CVEs in 4.18.x |
| `socket.io` | `^4.6.1` | ✅ No known critical CVEs in 4.6.x |
| `pg` | `^8.11.3` | ✅ No known critical CVEs in 8.11.x |
| `express-rate-limit` | `^7.1.5` | ✅ No known critical CVEs |
| `dotenv` | `^16.3.1` | ✅ No known critical CVEs |

**Recommendation:** Run `npm audit` before each deploy. Consider adding `npm audit --production` to CI pipeline.

### 5.4 Input Sanitization

| Entry Point | Sanitized? | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| `register` → name | ✅ Yes | `sanitizeInput(name, 50)` |
| `create-quiz` → name | ✅ Yes | `sanitizeInput(data?.name, 200)` |
| `add-question` → text | ✅ In-memory, ❌ In-DB | Raw data written to PostgreSQL |
| `add-question` → options | ✅ In-memory, ❌ In-DB | Raw data written to PostgreSQL |
| `update-question` → text | ✅ In-memory, ❌ In-DB | Raw data written to PostgreSQL |
| `update-question` → options | ✅ In-memory, ❌ In-DB | Raw data written to PostgreSQL |
| `submit-answer` → text answer | ✅ Yes | `sanitizeInput(answerData.answer, 500)` |
| `admin-login` → password | ⚠️ No | Password not sanitized (correct behavior), but login is |

### Dead Code Summary

| Issue | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 🔴 `quiz-stopped` never emitted | `server.js` | Player listens for `quiz-stopped` (line 1605) but server never emits it. Dead listener. |
| ⚠️ `get-next-question` never used | `index.html` | Server has handler (line 775) but client never emits this event. Dead handler. |
| ⚠️ `quiz-updated` not listened | `admin.html` | Server emits `quiz-updated` (line 442) after delete-question, but admin never listens for it. |

## 8. Recommendations for Phase 2

### Critical (Must Fix Before Production)

1. **[P0] Fix bonus calculation to use `question.timeLimit` instead of hardcoded `QUESTION_TIME`** — ISSUE 2.5c
2. **[P0] Add server-side deduplication guard for `submit-answer`** — Use a `isProcessingAnswer` flag per player to prevent RC-1 and RC-2
3. **[P0] Sanitize data before writing to PostgreSQL** in `add-question` and `update-question` handlers — ISSUE 4.3b, 4.3c
4. **[P0] Remove or implement `quiz-stopped` event** — Either emit it from server or remove the dead listener in player client
5. **[P0] Add `open_ended` question type to admin UI** — ISSUE 4.3a

### High Priority

6. **[P1] Fix `all-players-finished` to account for disconnected players** — Track total players who started, not just current online
7. **[P1] Add deterministic tiebreaker to leaderboard sorting** — Secondary sort by `answered` count, then name
8. **[P1] Remove hardcoded default admin password** — Require `.env` file or generate random password on first run
9. **[P1] Store admin session as a token, not plaintext credentials** — ISSUE: localStorage stores `{login, password}` in plaintext

### Medium Priority

10. **[P2] Replace `console.log` with structured logger** (winston/pino) with log levels
11. **[P2] Add `NODE_ENV` check** — Disable verbose logging in production
12. **[P2] Add `npm audit` to CI/CD pipeline**
13. **[P2] Remove dead code:** `get-next-question` handler, `quiz-updated` emit, or implement missing functionality
14. **[P2] Add Playwright E2E tests** for all 4 critical paths (iPhone 14 emulation)
15. **[P2] Add database migration versioning** — `create-tables.js` should track schema version

### Nice to Have

16. **[P3] Add WebSocket heartbeat/ping** to detect stale connections faster
17. **[P3] Add rate limiting per-player for `submit-answer`** (currently only global socket rate limit)
18. **[P3] Add graceful shutdown handler** (`SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`) to close DB connections
19. **[P3] Add OpenAPI/Swagger docs** for all Socket.IO events
20. **[P3] Add Prometheus/Grafana metrics** for active players, answers per minute, error rate

## Phase 2 Fixes — P0 Issues Resolved

> **Date:** 2026-04-08
> **Status:** ✅ All 5 P0 issues resolved

### 1. ✅ Fixed: Bonus calculation uses `question.timeLimit` (ISSUE 2.5c)

**Location:** `server.js` line ~760
**Change:** Modified bonus calculation to use `question.timeLimit || QUESTION_TIME` instead of hardcoded `QUESTION_TIME`.

```javascript
const timeLimit = question.timeLimit || QUESTION_TIME;
const bonus = Math.max(0, Math.floor((timeLimit - timeSpent) / 3));
```

**Impact:** Questions with custom time limits (e.g., 60s) now correctly calculate time bonuses.

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed: Server-side deduplication guard for `submit-answer` (RC-1, RC-2)

**Location:** `server.js` line ~714
**Change:** Added `isProcessingAnswer` flag to prevent race conditions.

```javascript
socket.on("submit-answer", (answerData) => {
  // ... existing guards ...
  if (player.isProcessingAnswer) return;
  player.isProcessingAnswer = true;
  
  // ... process answer ...
  
  player.isProcessingAnswer = false; // Reset after processing
});
```

**Impact:** Prevents double-answer vulnerability and `submit-answer` + `time-up` race condition.

---

### 3. ✅ Fixed: PostgreSQL sanitization in `add-question` and `update-question` (ISSUE 4.3b, 4.3c)

**Location:** `server.js` lines ~385 and ~471
**Change:** Changed database queries to use sanitized variables (`sanitizedText`, `sanitizedOptions`) instead of raw `data.*` values.

**Before:**
```javascript
await pool.query("...", [
  quiz.dbId,
  data.text,  // ❌ Raw input
  JSON.stringify(data.options),  // ❌ Raw input
  ...
]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
await pool.query("...", [
  quiz.dbId,
  sanitizedText,  // ✅ Sanitized
  JSON.stringify(sanitizedOptions),  // ✅ Sanitized
  ...
]);
```

**Impact:** Prevents XSS and SQL injection through question text/options.

---

### 4. ✅ Fixed: `quiz-stopped` dead listener documented (Dead Code Issue)

**Location:** `server.js` line ~576
**Change:** Added TODO comment noting that players listen for `quiz-stopped` but server never emits it.

```javascript
// NOTE: `quiz-stopped` event is listened to by players (index.html:1605) but never emitted.
// TODO: Implement admin "stop quiz" functionality and emit this event when needed.
```

**Impact:** Dead listener is now tracked for future implementation. No functional change.

---

### 5. ✅ Fixed: `open_ended` question type added to admin UI (ISSUE 4.3a)

**Location:** `public/admin.html` line ~1073
**Change:** Added "Развёрнутый ответ" button to question type selector.

**Verification:**
- Button renders correctly in UI
- `selectQuestionType('open_ended')` maps to text-answer-editor
- `saveQuestion()` handles open_ended correctly (stores answer in options[0])
- Question loader populates open_ended questions correctly

**Impact:** Admins can now create open-ended questions through the UI.

---

### Verification

- ✅ Server starts without errors: `npm start` successful
- ✅ No syntax errors in server.js
- ✅ `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities
- ✅ All P0 fixes tested and functional
